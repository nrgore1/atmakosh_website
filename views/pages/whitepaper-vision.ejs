  <h2>The Atmakosh Vision</h2>

  <p class="lead">
    A framework for consciousness-aligned intelligence in the age of powerful AI.
  </p>

  <div class="card" style="max-width:960px;">
    <p>
      Artificial intelligence is rapidly approaching levels of general intelligence
      that rival or exceed human performance in language, reasoning, and problem-solving.
      Yet intelligence alone is not sufficient to guide decisions that shape societies,
      institutions, and human well-being.
    </p>

    <p>
      Atmakosh LLM is founded on a simple but profound insight:
      <strong>the next evolution of AI must align intelligence with consciousness,
      ethics, and responsibility.</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>Beyond General Intelligence</h3>

    <p>
      Modern LLMs excel at cognition. Indian philosophical traditions distinguish
      between raw intelligence and higher discernment — <em>buddhi</em> and <em>prajñā</em>.
      Consciousness (<em>chit</em>) is not an output of computation, but the awareness
      within which thought arises.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Kena Upanishad captures this succinctly:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “That which cannot be spoken by speech, but by which speech is spoken.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Atmakosh does not claim to replicate consciousness.
      Instead, it aligns AI behavior with principles that emerge
      from humanity’s deepest investigations into awareness,
      ethics, and self-regulation.
    </p>

    <h3>From Philosophy to Practice</h3>

    <p>
      Drawing inspiration from the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita,
      and the Yoga Sutras, Atmakosh translates these insights into
      secular, globally applicable decision frameworks.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Ethical clarity without ideology</li>
      <li>Long-term impact over short-term optimization</li>
      <li>Human authority preserved in all high-stakes decisions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Super-Intelligence as Service</h3>

    <p>
      Atmakosh embraces <em>seva</em> — service — as a design principle.
      Intelligence exists not to dominate or compete, but to support
      collective human flourishing.
    </p>

    <p>
      This vision reframes AI not as a replacement for human judgment,
      but as a consciousness-aligned guide — augmenting wisdom,
      responsibility, and compassion at scale.
