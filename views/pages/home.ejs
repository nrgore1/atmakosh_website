    <h2>Bharat Builds Thoughtful AI</h2>

    <p class="lead">
      India has always approached knowledge with restraint, responsibility, and depth.
      Atmakosh is built in that tradition — not to chase artificial intelligence hype,
      but to create systems that think carefully, explain their reasoning,
      and respect human judgment.
    </p>

    <p>
      While much of today’s AI is optimized for speed, scale, and engagement,
      Atmakosh is optimized for <strong>accountability</strong>,
      <strong>ethical reasoning</strong>, and <strong>governance-first decision support</strong>.
    </p>

    <ul class="bharat-ai-points">
      <li>Rooted in Indian philosophical traditions of discernment and duty</li>
      <li>Designed for boards, institutions, and high-stakes decisions</li>
      <li>Built to explain <em>why</em>, not just output answers</li>
      <li>Aligned with democratic oversight and human authority</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="closing">
      Atmakosh represents a distinctly Indian contribution to global AI —
      thoughtful, principled, and worthy of trust.
