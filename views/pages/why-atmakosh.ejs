    <h1>Why Atmakosh</h1>

    <p class="lead">
      Most AI systems are designed to generate outputs.
      Atmakosh is designed to support judgment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Atmakosh exists because high-stakes decisions — in governance,
      enterprise, policy, and ethics — require more than pattern prediction.
      They require traceability, reasoning, and responsibility.
    </p>

    <h3>What makes Atmakosh different</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Governance-first architecture</li>
      <li>Explainable reasoning, not opaque answers</li>
      <li>Human-in-the-loop by design</li>
      <li>Aligned with institutional accountability</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Atmakosh is not built to replace human decision-makers.
      It is built to make them better informed, more consistent,
      and more accountable.
